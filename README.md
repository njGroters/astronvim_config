# My AstroNvim Config

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v4+

There are many like it, but this one is mine. Forked from [the config template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) a while ago.

If you haven't already, check out [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)! It may also be helpful to skim their [Getting Started docs](https://docs.astronvim.com/#-installation)

This repo was creating by following the [Managing User Configuration docs](https://docs.astronvim.com/configuration/manage_user_config) (specifically the `Followed Getting Started` section)
